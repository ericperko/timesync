Assignment 3, Problem 3

There are two processes for this problem. The server process and the receiver process. The server process
listens for the receiver to send it requests for time syncs. The receiver uses the timestamps from the server
process in order to calculate the change value. After calculating the change value, the receiver outputs that value to
the screen and exits.

Note: I do not actually adjust the system clock, only disply the calculated clock difference.

Also, if testing on multiple machines and getting errors, make sure that they are both Linux 32-bit, 
as that is what I have tested this on.

To Compile:
	make

To Run:
	./server.out
	./receiver.out <server-ip>
